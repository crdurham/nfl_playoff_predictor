    "\n",
    "This mini project began as a self-driven exercise as I was reading chapter 4 of \"An Introduction to Statistical Learning\" by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor. The goal is to determine which rudimentary or team-level statistics (if any) from the previous NFL season can be used to predict whether or not a team will make the playoffs in the next season. This will broadly measure how success or failure in one season carries over to the next."

    "All data was obtained from Pro Football Reference (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) for the regular seasons between 1990-2024. The data was collected in two stages and via two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in my stubbornness and refusal to use web scraping, I manually copied and pasted the yearly team standings (see the AFC and NFC tables at https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2024/, for example) into a spreadsheet. I then manually changed the team names to reflect the current franchise abbreviations (e.g. 'Houston Oilers' and 'Tennessee Oilers' $\\mapsto$ 'TEN' for the Tennessee Titans). To cap off this unnecessarily tedious endeavor, I added a column 'Playoffs' in which a 1 indicates a team made the playoffs that season and a 0 indicates they did not."
